These are my dotfiles that I use. 

Note that this repo and it's documentation is not finished yet so there's stuff that doesn't work.

# How to use my dotfiles

There are couple of ways how to use my dotfiles and dotfiles in general.

Pick whatever suites you best.

## You know what you are doing

Just clone my repo

```git
git clone https://github.com/valtteriviirret/.dotfiles.git
```

Or just copy code straight from github. Whatever suits you best.

## Git bare repository (recommended)

The best way to manage dotfiles in my opinion is git bare repository.

I used this tutorial myself and I think it's pretty good.

You can still use my dotfiles with this practise but you have to make the repo yourself.
