These dotfiles creates VIM-centric workflow that fits for me.

Please note that this repositoy is created with Arch Linux in mind and some parts may require extra configuration for other distributions.

# How to use my dotfiles

There are couple of ways how to use my dotfiles and dotfiles in general.

You can pick up my configuration with the install script or create similar repository with git bare repository.

## The install script

- clone my repository normally
- load dependencies

```
curl build-essential cmake python3
```
- run the install script

## Git bare repository

The best way to manage dotfiles in my opinion is git bare repository.

I used this tutorial myself and I think it's pretty good.

You can still use my dotfiles with this practise but you have to make the repo yourself.
